    <h3>Early History</h3>
    <p>Guitarist and vocalist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney first met when they were eight or nine years old while living in the same neighborhood of Akron, Ohio.[3] Auerbach and Carney both come from musical backgrounds. Auerbach is the cousin of guitarist Robert Quine, a "veteran of New York's avant-rock scene." Carney is the nephew of saxophonist Ralph Carney, who performed on several Tom Waits albums. While attending Firestone High School, they became friends,[3] though they were part of different crowds[4]—Auerbach was captain of the high school soccer team, while Carney was a social outcast.[5] Encouraged by their brothers, the duo began jamming together in 1996, as Auerbach was learning guitar at the time and Carney owned a four-track recorder and a drum set.[6][7] After graduating, both briefly attended the University of Akron before dropping out.[4][8]</p>
    <h3>Formation, The Big Come Up, and Thickfreakness (2001–2003) </h3>

    <p>Auerbach attempted to make a living from performing at small bars in town, but realized he would not be able to book shows in other cities without a demo. To record one, he asked for help from Carney, who agreed to provide recording equipment and allow his basement to be used if Auerbach recruited the other musicians. However, none of Auerbach's backing band showed up on the recording date.[4] Instead, Carney and Auerbach jammed, eventually leading to the duo forming a band in mid-2001.[4][9] Together, they recorded a six-song demo consisting of "old blues rip-offs and words made up on the spot" with minimal equipment.[4] After sending the demo to a dozen record labels, they accepted an offer in 2002 from a small indie label in Los Angeles named Alive,[6][10] because it was "the only label that would sign [them] without having to see [them] first".[11]</p>
